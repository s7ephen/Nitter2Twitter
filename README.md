# Nitter2Twitter

A Chrome/Brave plugin to right-click twitter links and open them on Nitter...
and vice versa: right-click Nitter links and open them in Twitter.

It's stupid simple, so if you wanna improve it (like add logic to the javascript, nest the context-menu, etc) please feel free 
and do a pull request.

# Why?

If you miss the ability to anonymously scroll through Twitter timelines
and read tweet comments without being logged in, then you probably have 
been using Nitter.

If you have been using Nitter then you also know that some things (like video playback)
work better when viewed directly on twitter. Or maybe after browsing on Nitter, you want to
comment on something using your authenticated Twitter session.

This just flips back and forth with a right-click context menu.
